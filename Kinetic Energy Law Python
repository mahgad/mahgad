# kinetic energy law python

# the law  :  kinetic energy = half of the mass x speed box


x = input("Enter the mass :")
y = input("Enter the speed :")

m = float(x)
s = float(y)

kg = (m / 2) * (s ** 2)  # kg is kinetic energy

print("kinetic energy is :", kg, "jol")
if s == 0:
    print("The Body is static")
